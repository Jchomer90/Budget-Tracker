  ## Description

    In a perfect world, a user would have perfect connectivity on all their devices. However, in the event connectivity is lost, maintaining functionality becomes a huge asset. The Budget Tracker application is designed to allow the user to add/subract funds regardless of their network connection, and not miss a beat. 

    Utilizing indexedDB in addition to MongoDB and mongoose, any transactions made offline will store as pending in the database, ensuring to update once connectivity is achieved.
